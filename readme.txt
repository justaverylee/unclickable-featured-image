A wordpress plugin that forces all featured images to NOT be links

== Description ==

If your theme makes thumbnail pictures links (which casuses a useless refresh on click), 
use this plugin to disable that. That's it. There is no options menu, or settings.
Once enabled, it will make every featured image (on a post/page) unclickable.

== Installation ==

Installation:
1. Download this repository
2. Upload the 'unclickable-featured-image' folder to your webserver
3. Place the 'unclickable-featured-image' folder in the '/wp-content/plugins' folder
4.  Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin console

OR:
1. Install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin from the WordPress admin console

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why would I use this? =

A select few themes make their thumbnails clickable (like the title of the page) and cause
a redirect to the current page. This plugin removes that without modifying the theme itself.

= How do I know if the plugin is working? =

The easiest way it to hover over a thumbnail and look at where the link points (usually 
shown in the corner of your browser). If the plugin is active, the link will point 
to 'javascript:void(0);'

== Screenshots ==

None. This plugin should make no changes to the look of your site.
