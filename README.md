# unclickable-featured-image-wp
A wordpress plugin that forces all featured images to NOT be links

If your theme makes thumbnail pictures links (which casuses a useless refresh on click), 
use this plugin to disable that. That's it. There is no options menu, or settings.
Once enabled, it will make every featured image (on a post/page) unclickable.

Installation:
- Download this repository
- Upload the 'unclickable-featured-image' folder to your webserver
- Place the 'unclickable-featured-image' folder in the '/wp-content/plugins' folder
- Activate the plugin from the Wordpress admin console
